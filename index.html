<h1>Principal Message</h1>
<p> Cyber Institute of Technology  is one of the most established institutions in KPK. Being the oldest Institute of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, it offers Computer courses, English Language typing, digital marketing and shorthand. it offers immense educational and research opportunities; and at the same time, faces daunting challenges. While we are aware of the extreme significance of Computer education for the people of Shabqadar and  the surrounding area, we also keep a vigilant eye on the needs and requirements of the local and global markets. We try our best to address our social, academic, cultural, and economic problems in a befitting manner.
    Our teaching faculty and researchers always remained proud of their excellence in teaching and high standards in research. They have been actively involved in training students since the establishment of this alma mater and this is a matter of pride for all of us. We are confident that they will take our beloved Institute further to the height of its success in the current highly competitive circumstances. We would love to provide to our teaching faculty and staff the very best available resources and do away with the existing economic constraints. We believe that our teaching faculty; our staff; and our students have the talent and the potential to play important role to change the socio-economic conditions of our community for the better.
    Modern trends in the field of Technology and commerce make new demands of institute.   A major aim of the application of knowledge should be the creation of job opportunities for people of the region. We have to strengthen our focus to gradually shift from being a consumer society to a producing society. We have to reach out to the community around us and think of ways to interact with them professionally. We also have to be aware of how to go along with the international community. We cannot perform effectively without collaboration with our professional and academic counterparts within the country and abroad. Let us make a firm resolve to strengthen this Institute further.
